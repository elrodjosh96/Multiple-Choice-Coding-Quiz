# Multiple-Choice-Coding-Quiz

I have done my best to create a 5 question multiple chocice coding quiz. After you click the, "start" button you will be given 75 seconds to answer the questions correctly. 5 seconds will be taken off for every wrong answer. After the test, you will be able to see your score and save it to the local storage.
